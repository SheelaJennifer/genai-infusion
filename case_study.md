#  GENAI-POWERED DATA MIGRATION: REDEFINING LEGACY EFFICIENCY

## üìå Introduction: From Exhaustion to Innovation

Data migration especially across legacy systems is traditionally a manual, error-prone, and exhausting process.  
One of the most tedious tasks is migrating stored procedures written in **DB2 LUW** into modern databases like **PostgreSQL**.  
The syntax, data types, control structures, and platform-specific quirks demand careful rewrites, often consuming hours per routine.

To overcome this, I infused **Generative AI (GenAI)** into the workflow.  
**The result?** A faster, smarter, and far more accurate process that reduces repetitive manual effort while maintaining high precision.

## üéØ Use Case Focus: DB2 LUW ‚ûú PostgreSQL

This project automates the conversion of stored procedures and table structures from **IBM DB2 LUW** to **PostgreSQL**, using GenAI to:

-  Convert legacy logic into PostgreSQL-compatible syntax  
-  Generate DDL scripts and data loaders  
-  Perform validation and testing seamlessly  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Script 1: SP Conversion + Validation via GenAI

This script is a **multi-functional powerhouse**:

- Accepts DB2 stored procedures as input  
- Sends them to an **LLM API (OpenAI GPT-4.5)** for automated translation into PostgreSQL  
- Includes built-in **validation and test case generation**

 **One script does it all**:  
You don‚Äôt need to manually review or test every line.  
It creates **reusable templates**, flags **edge cases**, and writes **PostgreSQL-ready code** with test coverage embedded.

---

##  Script 2: DDL & Data Load Automation

Using just **CSV data** and **metadata**, this script:

- Generates the corresponding **DDL (table schema)** using GenAI  
- Creates **INSERT scripts** or `COPY` commands for fast data loading  
- Applies **dynamic mapping** based on column names and types  

 This is a **game-changer** when handling hundreds of flat files or avoiding manual DDL scripting bottlenecks.

## üîÅ Reusability & Extensibility

Both scripts are built to be:

-  **Modular** ‚Äì Plug and play with new inputs  
-  **Customizable** ‚Äì Easily extend prompt logic and validation checks  
-  **Scalable** ‚Äì Ideal for large-scale migrations with repeatable patterns

## üîå APIs & Tools Used

| Tool / Library           | Purpose                                        |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `OpenAI GPT-4.5 API`     | Code translation, DDL generation, validation   |
| `Python (openai, psycopg2)` | DB connection, file handling, metadata ops  |
| `Custom Prompt Templates`| Tailored for DB2 ‚ûú PG conversion logic         |
| `Optional Flask Wrapper` | If deploying as UI/API microservice           |

##  Results & Value Add

```bash
Activity             | Traditional Time | GenAI Time | Accuracy
---------------------|------------------|------------|---------
SP Conversion        | 1‚Äì2 hrs/SP       | <10 mins   | ~90%
DDL + Data Load      | 30‚Äì60 mins/table | ~5 mins    | ~95%
Validation/Test Case | Manual scripting | Auto-gen   | Consistent
```

##  Summary

This project showcases how **GenAI isn't just a coding assistant‚Äîit's an enabler of modernization.**

By targeting **DB2 LUW to PostgreSQL migration**, and automating both **logic conversion** and **data loading**, this approach:

-  **Reduces effort by 10x**  
-  **Improves reliability and accuracy**  
-  **Provides reusability** across similar migration workloads
